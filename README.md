Project Abstract
Sewjo is a web application designed to help sewing enthusiasts manage their fabric stashes,
PDF sewing patterns, and sewing projects. Users can create and edit profiles, manage their
fabric inventories, upload and organize PDF patterns, and track the progress of their sewing
projects. The application will also offer optional advanced features like OCR for pattern data
extraction and e-commerce integration for seamless fabric management from online purchases.

Customer
The primary customers for Sewjo are sewing enthusiasts and hobbyists who need a
comprehensive tool to organize their sewing materials and projects. This diverse group
encompasses a wide range of users, each with specific needs and preferences.

Individual Sewists:
● Hobbyists and Home Sewists: Individuals who sew as a hobby or for personal use.
Sewjo can provide these users with a centralized platform to streamline their sewing
activities and enhance their productivity.

● Amateur Sewists: Those who are new to sewing and are looking for a user-friendly tool
to help them manage their materials and projects efficiently.

Small Sewing Groups:
● Community Groups and Clubs: Small groups of sewing enthusiasts who meet regularly
to share their passion for sewing. Sewjo can help these groups manage their collective
projects, share resources, and keep track of individual contributions.

● Sewing Classes and Workshops: Instructors and participants in sewing classes and
workshops can use Sewjo to manage class projects, share patterns, and track progress.

Fabric Stores:
● Small and Independent Fabric Stores: Retailers looking to offer value-added services to
their customers can integrate Sewjo into their business model. By providing customers
with a tool to manage their fabric purchases, these stores can enhance customer
satisfaction and loyalty.

Competitive Analysis
Existing solutions in the market include various fabric and project management apps, but none
offer a fully integrated solution combining fabric management, pattern organization, and project
tracking. For example, many apps allow users to manage their fabric stash, but they do not
provide adequate features for organizing PDF sewing patterns or tracking project progress.
Similarly, there are tools for project management in the sewing domain that do not support
detailed fabric inventory management.
Sewjo differentiates itself by providing a user-friendly interface, robust fabric and pattern
management features, and optional advanced functionalities like OCR and e-commerce
integration. This makes Sewjo a unique and comprehensive tool in the sewing community.
